# OIBSIP_Python_Task2
ðŸ“– Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height and weight. This project helps improve understanding of basic user input handling, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations in Python, while providing a practical health-related utility.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Fundamental programming concepts)

Input and output functions (input(), print())

Conditional statements (if-elif-else)

Basic math operations

Any Python IDE or text editor such as VS Code or PyCharm

ðŸš€ Steps Performed
Collected user input for height (cm) and weight (kg).

Converted height to meters.

Verified that height and weight are positive values.

Calculated BMI using the standard formula.

Displayed the BMI to the user.

Categorized BMI into health ranges and showed the result.

Handled invalid inputs with an error message.

ðŸ–¥ Output
The program asks the user to enter their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms. After calculating the BMI, it displays the BMI value along with a message indicating the userâ€™s weight category (such as underweight, normal, overweight, etc.). If invalid inputs are entered, it prompts the user to provide valid values.
